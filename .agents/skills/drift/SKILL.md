# toolkit-owned; edits are drift — see AGENTS.md

Run the `drift` operator defined in this repo's `AGENTS.md` (Operator
Requests): compare a doc, decision, or guidance claim against repo evidence
and fix the lower-authority source, or report the unresolved conflict.
Guidance files (`AGENTS.md`, `.agents/*`) are in scope as drift targets, not
just sources. The operator also owns the deliberate state-hygiene pass
(archive rotation, re-verification of parked items, machine-fact
relocation) as defined there. `AGENTS.md` is the authoritative definition;
this skill is only a pointer.
