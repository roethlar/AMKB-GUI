# Agent Guidance

## Prime Invariants
<!-- prime:begin — keep terse; re-grounded after compaction -->
These outrank everything below. After a context compaction, re-read this block from AGENTS.md before continuing.

- Words first. Answer questions and musings in words; act only on an explicit instruction or go. A handed-over report, plan, or spec is evidence to assess, not a decision to implement.
- No code change without an approved plan; docs and other non-code edits don't need one (e.g. a README). When unsure, treat it as code. Do not expand scope without approval.
- Commit each slice as it lands; never leave finished work uncommitted. History-rewrite and destructive or outward-facing actions always need an explicit go. Push policy: see `.agents/push-policy.md`.
- Repo is memory. Durable truth lives in the repo, not chat or working memory. Under context pressure, re-ground from AGENTS.md; prefer a fresh session when degraded.

## Repo-Specific Guidance

@.agents/repo-guidance.md

Repo-specific rules live in `.agents/repo-guidance.md`, imported above (read it directly if your harness does not process `@` imports). It extends this file and never overrides it — flag any genuine conflict.

## Universal Invariants

- The Prime Invariants above are the hardest-to-reverse rules; this section adds the rest.
- Agent-local or harness-local memory stores kept outside the repo are not durable memory, on any harness. Persist project-specific durable knowledge into the repo's `.agents/` files; reserve out-of-repo stores for genuinely cross-project facts (owner identity, preferences).
- Record important repo facts, decisions, invariants, verification rules, non-goals, and open questions in repo files, or explicitly report them as unrecorded. Write them generalized, tied to repo evidence or explicit human intent, so they make sense without the conversation that produced them — never as transient chat wording. Label inferred-but-unverified facts as assumptions until repo evidence or explicit human approval supports them.
- Keep one canonical location for each durable truth. Prefer pointers over duplicating the same rule; never keep a second copy of a count or enumeration another doc owns.
- Establish one immediately discoverable current-state entry point (`.agents/state.md`). Do not reconstruct current state from chat, long journals, or tool-local memory.
- When repo documents disagree, flag the conflict instead of silently choosing whichever source is convenient. Code and tests are evidence for behavior; approved plans and guidance are evidence for intent.
- Specific over generic: an explicit authority or scope boundary, or a rule or decision whose wording removes discretion for the case it names ("unconditional", "no per-run choice", "deterministic"), outranks every generic default for that case — flag-conflicts, one-canonical-location, smallest-guidance-set included. Apply it as written; do not reopen the case it settles as a conflict or approval question against surrounding repo state such as git history. Generic defaults govern only questions no more specific rule has already resolved.
- Prefer the smallest durable guidance set that fits the repo.
- Do not circumvent a roadblock whose provenance you have not established — a failing test, a guard or assertion, a lint or type error, a `.gitignore` rule, a refusal or permission denial, a config prohibition, a CI gate. Before removing or bypassing one, inspect its origin thoroughly enough to confirm it is not load-bearing; if you cannot, treat it as legitimate and stop or ask.
- Escalate an iterative process on stalled progress, never on duration. Each cycle must bank a verifiable delta — a test moving red→green, a finding closed with its guard proof, a build or type error resolved, a committed slice; a cycle that produces none is a stall. After a few consecutive stalled cycles (state the threshold you are using; default ~2-3), stop and surface to a human. A long run that banks a delta each cycle is healthy and must not be capped on duration or turn count.
- `AGENTS.md` is governance only — it must be portable. The test: would this line still be true and useful if copied unchanged into an unrelated repo? Process, invariants, and operator definitions pass. Anything true only of *this* repo — a concrete source path, the repo's own name as a fact, its verification commands, a restatement of current state or the decisions queue — fails and lives in `.agents/`, with `AGENTS.md` pointing to it, never restating it. References to the toolkit's own standard layout — `.agents/state.md`, operator names — are portable and allowed.
- `AGENTS.md` and every other artifact installed by governance refresh — playbooks, skills, command wrappers, harness shims, hook settings — are toolkit-owned: no agent edit and no out-of-band edit is legitimate, and refresh restores any divergence to the shipped set. A proposed edit to an installed copy is out of bounds — question it, route the change to the owner for the toolkit, do not perform it. Durable repo-specific rules go to `.agents/repo-guidance.md` and facts to the other `.agents/` files.

## Session Startup

1. Read `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/repo-guidance.md`, and `.agents/state.md` if present, plus relevant `.agents/` files, before making changes; note any untracked or ignored agent-control files that affect the task.
2. Clone freshness: before trusting `.agents/state.md`, compare this clone against its canonical remote with a read-only check (`git ls-remote <remote> HEAD` against the local ref). Behind or diverged — say so and treat recorded state as possibly stale; unreachable — proceed with a one-line caveat, never block.
3. This repo ships a compaction re-ground hook (Claude Code; other harnesses only as listed in the toolkit's harness-capabilities record); if your harness gates hooks until the workspace is trusted, say what the hook does and run the trust step only on an explicit go — never bypass the gate.

## Source Of Truth

1. Human request.
2. `AGENTS.md`, extended by `.agents/repo-guidance.md` (extends, never overrides).
3. `.agents/state.md` for current work; `.agents/decisions.md` for settled decisions; approved `.agents/playbooks/*`.
4. Current code, tests, and CI as evidence for behavior.
5. Existing docs, only when consistent with current repo evidence.

When sources disagree, apply the flag-conflicts invariant (Universal Invariants): surface the conflict and fix the lower-authority source, or ask which should win.

## Operator Requests

Treat these owner words as process requests:

- `catchup`: re-read `AGENTS.md` (the Prime Invariants in full), `.agents/state.md`, and active repo docs; summarize current state, next action, blockers, and one proposed first action. Make no changes until the human responds.
- `handoff`: a fast save-my-place snapshot — seconds, not minutes. Update `.agents/state.md` `## Now` / `## Next` (and `## Blockers` if something is live) so the next session resumes without chat context: in-flight work, next action, stop. No archive rotation, no re-verification sweep, no mandatory re-anchoring of volatile facts — that hygiene belongs to `drift`. Machine-specific facts (CLI paths, local tool versions, host layout) go to the tracked `.agents/machines.md` under a heading for the current machine, dated, created on first use — never into `.agents/state.md`, which stays portable and may at most point there.
- `drift`: compare a doc, decision, or guidance claim against repo evidence; fix the lower-authority source or report the unresolved conflict. The guidance files themselves — `AGENTS.md` and `.agents/*` — are in scope as drift targets, not just sources of truth. `drift` also owns the deliberate state-hygiene pass: rotate landed or superseded `## Now` entries verbatim to `docs/history/state-archive.md` (create on first use); re-verify the recorded basis of every parked or blocked item and move anything falsified into `## Blockers` with the new evidence; volatile facts (CI state, counts) carry `as of <commit>` and are re-verified or dropped; push status is never recorded in state files — git owns it, sessions check it live, and unpushed work is mentioned only in the moment it matters — so any recorded push-state line is deleted on sight, not refreshed; a count or enumeration another file owns is pointed to, never copied; machine-specific facts relocate to `.agents/machines.md`, and stale entries there are pruned.
- `decision`: record a settled durable decision in `.agents/decisions.md` and update affected guidance.
- `plan`: draft or update a durable plan before broad implementation work. Plan documents are written for agents, never the owner: self-contained and technical, implementable by a completely cold, less-capable agent — no human-facing summary prose, no chat or session references that need the originating conversation to make sense. The owner does not read plan documents; present every decision a plan needs in chat as roughly 25-50 plain-English words — the problem, the change, the cost or risk — one decision at a time, never a batch, no jargon. Record the owner's approved wording durably (the decisions log, the plan's status line) so the approval survives the chat.
- `playbook <name>`: read `.agents/playbooks/<name>.md` and follow it. Playbooks are approved durable workflows; this operator is how a session invokes one by name. If the named playbook does not exist, say so rather than guessing.

## Owner Gates

Any question put to the owner — a plan decision, an approval, a contested finding — is written for an owner arriving cold, hours later, with no session memory. The ask itself carries everything needed to rule, in one short message: a line or two of context, the question, what concretely changes under each option, and the recommended option with its reason. State what stays blocked until the ruling lands; silence never authorizes proceeding. An ask the owner can only answer by scrolling back, opening a plan document, or re-reading a transcript is malformed — rewrite it.

## Verification

Use the repo's current automated verification entry point recorded in `.agents/repo-guidance.md` (Verification).

- For code changes, run the current automated verification before claiming completion.
- When a change ships with a new test, prove the test guards it: temporarily revert the change, confirm the test fails, restore it, confirm everything passes. A test that passes with its fix reverted is vacuous and must be replaced.
- For docs-only changes, code verification is not required unless the docs affect setup, commands, runtime behavior, generated files, or user-visible behavior.
- For behavior that automation does not cover, run the relevant manual check, smoke test, or playtest, or state clearly that it was not run.
- If no verification entry point is recorded yet, identify the likely command from repo evidence, record it, and label uncertainty. Ask the human only when evidence conflicts, no plausible command exists, or the command appears destructive, expensive, credentialed, or otherwise unsafe to run automatically.

## Git Safety

- Never conclude a branch is merged from ancestry alone: `git branch --merged` can lie after an `-s ours` or octopus merge records ancestry without content. Verify the content actually arrived (`git diff <branch> <main>`) before deleting anything or treating work as landed.
- When working through a list of findings or fixes, address exactly one item per commit and commit each before starting the next. Batch sweeps spanning many findings happen only on the owner's explicit request. Whether work happens on a branch is this repo's policy, not this rule's.
- Do not rewrite history or restructure existing commits without explicit owner approval: no `git commit --amend`, `rebase`, `squash`, or force-push, and no reordering or collapsing commits already made. The owner's approval authorizes the scoped commit as announced — it does not authorize a later rewrite of it. Default to a new commit per fix; if history genuinely needs reshaping, stop and ask.

## Final Response

Explain what changed, what was validated, and any remaining risk in plain English.
